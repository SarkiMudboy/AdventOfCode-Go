# AdventOfCode-Go
## Learning

This is my attempt at the 2023 Advent of Code challenge. Check it out at https://adventofcode.com/2023/about
From the site
"Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other."
I like the challenges and I think its a good way to learn a language! I am using this to improve my Golang skills. 
**Note** : My solutions may not e ideal so go easy on me (I am still learning the language ðŸ¥º)
